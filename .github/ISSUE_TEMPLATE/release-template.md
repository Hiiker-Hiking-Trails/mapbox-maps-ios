## ðŸ“¦ Release MapboxMaps

Notes: Unless otherwise specified, `VERSION` refers to the SEMVER tag with the `v` prefix.

Before you begin, check that the [MapboxCommon](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-common/releases) and [MapboxCoreMaps](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-core-maps-ios/releases) versions that you will use have been released and are available to download via CocoaPods and SPM. 

### Pull requests:
- [ ] mapbox-maps-ios release PR ->
- [ ] api-downloads PR ->
- [ ] mapbox-maps-ios docs PR ->
- [ ] ios-sdk PR ->
- [ ] studio-preview-ios PR ->
 
**1) Create Release Branch & Kickoff Build**

- [ ] Pull the latest from main to include all code updates. Then make a new branch called "Release/{VERSION}"
- [ ] Ensure you have `jq` installed: `$ brew install jq`
- [ ] Update the internal version pointers by running this command `./scripts/release/update-version.sh {VERSION}`. Commit these changes so they will be included in the build. This script also bumps the `maps_version` in MapboxMaps.podspec to match `VERSION`.
- [ ] Perform manual QA of this branch by running:
  - [ ] `mapbox-maps-ios` examples
  - [ ] [Studio Preview](https://github.com/mapbox/studio-preview-ios/). Update the Podfile to point to the release branch. Check for any breaking changes in the code and any visible performance issues.
- [ ] Verify installation via SPM. Open a tester single view application. Go to the Swift Package Manager menu and add our repo `https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios.git`. For the branch, specify the release branch. Then verify that you can load the SDK, and display a basic map on device to verify that the build is working.
- [ ] Open a PR for the "Release/{VERSION}" branch. This allows CI to run.
- [ ] Kickoff the build by passing an empty commit with the message "[release] {VERSION}", with the SEMVER version but no `v` prefix. For example: `git commit --allow-empty -m "[release] 10.0.0-rc.1"`. It's important that you follow the commit message as it triggers the build job.

***What will this job do?***

- Build our direct-download bundle
- Include LICENSE.md and README.md for bundle in the zip files
- Upload direct download to S3
- Create a PR [here](https://github.com/mapbox/api-downloads/pulls) so that our SDK can be consumed
- [ ] The API Downloads PR needs to be approved and merged before continuing. You do not need to merge your PR in `mapbox-maps-ios` yet.

**2) Update Distribution & Changelog**

- [ ] Generate the changelog manually by adding changes to the `CHANGELOG.md` file. Commit these changes have your release buddy review them. 
- [ ] Review issues [tagged with the Release](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/maps-sdk-for-ios-5e9f47ffdf1ce5046f9011f4/reports/release) adding or removing the release from the Zenhub issues as necessary.

**3) Create the Release Tag**

- [ ] Create a SEMVER tag, e.g. `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` and push the tag to GitHub: 
    - `git tag <version> && git push origin <version>`
    - This will trigger a CircleCI workflow that will produce the following artifacts (can be [found here](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios)):
        - an api-docs.zip
	- The completion of this job will make our api-docs which will be found in ci artifacts. It will also publish a GitHub draft release
- [ ] Push the release to CocoaPods via `$ pod trunk push`
- [ ] Update the information in the draft release with the correct changelog, versions, etc.
- [ ] Uncheck the prerelease box.
- [ ] Have your release buddy review the draft release, and save the draft. You will publish it in a later step.

**4) Confirm everything works as expected**

- [ ] Download the artifacts from the SDK registry. The zip file will include five xcframeworks. Create a new iOS application project in Xcode, and add all the frameworks. In the view controller, load a basic map view to ensure everything works as expected.
- [ ] Repeat the SDK registry testing for the static variant, available at `https://api.mapbox.com/downloads/v2/mobile-maps-ios-static/releases/ios/<version-without-v-previx>/MapboxMaps-static.zip`
- [ ] Test that consumption via CocoaPods works. SPM should have been verified at an earlier step

## ðŸ“š Update documentation

- [ ] Navigate to the [CircleCI job page](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios), and download the `api-docs.zip` artifact.
- [ ] In the `mapbox-maps-ios` repo, `git checkout publisher-staging && git merge --no-ff origin/publisher-staging`. This is the branch that houses our API-Docs. Make a new branch off this one `git checkout -b Release/{version}_docs`
- [ ] Unzip the `api-docs.zip` and move the new docs into our repo. This should result in a new top-level folder named after the version, but without the 'v' prefix.

### Add framework docs

* Temporary step while we are working on more docs automation
- [ ] Find the `MapboxCoreMaps` [release](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-internal/releases). Locate the version of `MapboxCoreMaps` being used in this release and download `MapboxCoreMaps-iOS-API-Reference.zip`.
- [ ] Find the `MapboxCommon` [release](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-common/releases). Locate the version of `MapboxCommon` being used in this release and download `ios-api-reference.zip`.
- [ ] unzip the docs using the following commands:
    - MapboxCoreMaps `unzip <path>/MapboxCoreMaps-iOS-API-Reference.zip -d core`
    - MapboxCommon `unzip <path>/ios-api-reference.zip -d common`
- [ ] Move the unzipped directories, `core` and `common` to the root of the Maps SDK docs that you moved at an earlier step
- [ ] Navigate to the Maps SDK docs and open `index.html` in a text editor. **NOTE: do not open index.html for `core` or `common`
- [ ] Navigate to the end of the `ul` tag which is embedded inside of the `nav` tag. This will be end of the navigation list. Append the follow html code to the list so that we can link the common and core documentation

```html
<li class="nav-group-name" data-name="Frameworks">
  <a class="small-heading" href="Frameworks.html">Frameworks<span class="anchor-icon" /></a>
  <ul class="nav-group-tasks">
    <li class="nav-group-task" data-name="MapboxCoreMaps">
      <a title="MapboxCoreMaps" class="nav-group-task-link" href="./core/index.html">MapboxCoreMaps</a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-group-task" data-name="MapboxCommon">
      <a title="MapboxCommon" class="nav-group-task-link" href="./common/index.html">MapboxCommon</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>
```

### Commit and propogate doc changes

- [ ] Commit and push those changes.
- [ ] Make a pull request targeting the branch `publisher-staging`.
- [ ] Share this with @mapbox/docs to approve.
- [ ] Merge the PR in `mapbox-maps-ios`.
- [ ] Preview the docs at the staging URL: https://docs.tilestream.net/ios/maps/api/{version_without_v_prefix}/index.html
- [ ] Create a PR to merge `publisher-staging` into `publisher-production`.
- [ ] Share the PR with @mapbox-docs to approve.
- [ ] Merge the PR. Do not use 'Squash and merge': this causes the publisher-staging and publisher-production branches to diverge.
- [ ] Create a `maps-{VERSION}` branch in [ios-sdk](https://github.com/mapbox/ios-sdk).
- [ ] Add the new version (without a v prefix) as the first element in the [src/data/ios-maps-sdk-version.json](https://github.com/mapbox/ios-sdk/blob/publisher-production/src/data/ios-maps-sdk-versions.json).
- [ ] While the rc docs site is live and for subsequent stable releases, add the version without the v to [src/constants.json](https://github.com/mapbox/ios-sdk/blob/ios/maps-v10.0.0-beta.13.1/src/constants.json#L6) as the value for `MAPS_SDK_v10_VERSION_IOS`.
- [ ] Make sure the API Docs changes are live in production before continuing https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/api/{version_without_v_prefix}/index.html
  - This is necessary because the CI checks triggered by the next step depend on them.
- [ ] Commit and push these changes, then open a PR.
- [ ] Ask your docs buddy to review it. Merge once approved!

## ðŸš¢ Publish the release

- [ ] Publish the GitHub draft. The release is now done!
