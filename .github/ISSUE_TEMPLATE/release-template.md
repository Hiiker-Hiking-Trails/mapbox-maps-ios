## ðŸ“¦ Release MapboxMaps

Notes: Unless otherwise specified, `VERSION` refers to the SEMVER tag with the `v` prefix.

Before you begin, check that the [MapboxCommon](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-sdk-common/releases) and [MapboxCoreMaps](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-core-maps-ios/releases) versions that you will use have been released and are available to download via CocoaPods and SPM. 

### Pull requests:
- [ ] mapbox-maps-ios release PR ->
- [ ] api-downloads PR ->
- [ ] mapbox-maps-ios docs PR ->
- [ ] ios-sdk PR ->
 
**1) Create Release Branch & Kickoff Build**

- [ ] Pull the latest from main to include all code updates. Then make a new branch called "Release/{VERSION}"
- [ ] Update the internal version pointers by running this command `./scripts/release/update-version.sh {VERSION}`. Commit these changes so they will be included in the build.
- [ ] Open a PR for the "Release/{VERSION}" branch. This allows CI to run.
- [ ] Kickoff the build by passing an empty commit with the message "[release] {VERSION}", with the SEMVER version but no `v` prefix. For example: `git commit --allow-empty -m "[release] 10.0.0-beta.14"`. It's important that you follow the commit message as it triggers the build job.

***What will this job do?***

- Build our direct-download bundle
- Include LICENSE.md and README.md for bundle in the zip files
- Upload direct download to S3
- Update the existing podspec and package manifest and commit that to the release branch
- Create a PR [here](https://github.com/mapbox/api-downloads/pulls) so that our SDK can be consumed
- [ ] The API Downloads PR needs to be approved and merged before continuing. You do not need to merge your PR in `mapbox-maps-ios` yet.

**2) Update Distribution & Changelog**

- [ ] On your local `Release/{VERSION}` branch, pull the latest from remote release branch. CI will have committed changes to podspec and package manifest.
- [ ] This is where we need to verify SPM update was successful. Open a tester single view application. Go to the Swift Package Manager menu and add our repo `https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios.git`. For the branch, specify your current release branch. Then verify that you can load the SDK, and display a basic map on device to verify that the build is working.
    - ***Note that the api-downloads PR needs to be merged and sanity checks need to complete before downloads are available here***
- [ ] Generate the changelog manually by addding changes to the `CHANGELOG.md` file. Commit these changes have your release buddy review them. 

**3) Create the Release Tag**

- [ ] Create a SEMVER tag, e.g. `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` and push the tag to GitHub: 
    - `git tag <version> && git push origin <version>`
    - This will trigger a CircleCI workflow that will produce the following artifacts (can be [found here](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios)):
        - an api-docs.zip
	- The completion of this job will make our api-docs which will be found in ci artifacts. It will also publish a GitHub draft release
- [ ] Push the release to CocoaPods via `$ pod trunk push`
- [ ] Update the information in the draft release with the correct changelog, versions, etc
- [ ] Have your release buddy review the draft release, and save the draft. You will publish it in a later step.

**4) Confirm everything works as expected**

- [ ] Download the artifacts from the SDK registry. The zip file will include five xcframeworks. Create a new iOS application project in Xcode, and add all the frameworks. In the view controller, load a basic map view to ensure everything works as expected.
- [ ] Test that consumption via CocoaPods works. SPM should have been verified at an earlier step

## ðŸ“š Update documentation

- [ ] Navigate to the [CircleCI job page](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/mapbox/mapbox-maps-ios), and download the `api-docs.zip` artifact.

- [ ] In the `mapbox-maps-ios` repo, `git checkout origin publisher-staging`. This is the branch that houses our API-Docs. Make a new branch off this one `git checkout -b Release/{version}_docs`
  - If you would like to test your API docs before publishing them, target the `publisher-staging` branch first, then once your PR lands there, cherry-pick your commit to a branch based on `publisher-production`.
- [ ] Unzip the `api-docs.zip` and move the new docs into our repo. 
- [ ] Commit and push those changes.
- [ ] Make a pull request targeting the branch `publisher-production`.
- [ ] Share this with @mapbox/docs to approve.
- [ ] Merge the PR in `mapbox-maps-ios`. Cherry-pick to the `publisher-production`
- [ ] Create a `maps-{VERSION}` branch in [ios-sdk](https://github.com/mapbox/ios-sdk).
- [ ] Add the new version (without a v prefix) as the first element in the [src/data/ios-maps-sdk-version.json](https://github.com/mapbox/ios-sdk/blob/publisher-production/src/data/ios-maps-sdk-versions.json).
- [ ] While the beta docs site is live and for subsequent stable releases, add the version without the v to [src/constants.json](https://github.com/mapbox/ios-sdk/blob/ios/maps-v10.0.0-beta.13.1/src/constants.json#L6) as the value for `VERSION_IOS_MAPS_SDK_V10`.
- [ ] Commit and push these changes, then open a PR.
- [ ] Ask your docs buddy to review it. Merge once approved!

## ðŸš¢ Publish the release

- [ ] Publish the GitHub draft. The release is now done!

## ðŸš¢ Merge your release branch
